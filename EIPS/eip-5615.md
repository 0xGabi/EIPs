## Abstract

This EIP standardizes an existing mechanism to fetch token supply data from [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens. It adds a `totalSupply` function, which fetches the number of tokens with a given `id`, and an `exists` function, which checks for the existence of a given `id`.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
interface ERC1155Supply /* is ERC1155 */ {
  // @notice      This function MUST return the total supply (the number of tokens) with a given id if the given id exists, previously existed, or may exist, otherwise it MUST revert
  // @param   id  The token id of which fetch the total supply
  // @return      The total supply of the given token ID
  function totalSupply(uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);

  // @notice      This function MUST return true if the given token id exists, previously existed, or may exist, otherwise it MUST return false
  // @param   id  The ID of which to check the existence
  // @return      Whether the given token ID exists or not
  function exists(uint256 id) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

This EIP does not use [EIP-165](./eip-165.md), as this interface is simple enough that the extra complexity is unnecessary. It would also cause incompatibilities with existing implementations that would otherwise be fully compatible.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues were found.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.
